# Telco Customer Churn Analysis

## Project Description

This project aims to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and build Machine Learning models to predict customer churn for a telecommunications company. By identifying the factors influencing customer churn, the analysis provides actionable insights that help in reducing churn and improving customer retention strategies.

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing of customer data.
- Exploratory Data Analysis to identify key factors influencing customer churn.
- Machine learning models for churn prediction.
- Performance evaluation of models using various metrics.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy (for data preprocessing and analysis)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for data visualization)
- Scikit-learn (for machine learning models)


## Machine Learning Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Gradient Boosting Classifier

## Future Enhancements
- Hyperparameter tuning for improved model performance.
- Integration with real-time customer data for live churn predictions.
- Development of a customer retention dashboard.

## Data Source
The dataset used for this analysis includes various customer attributes such as demographics, account information, and services used. The target variable is whether a customer churned or not.
